00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,640
Namaste and welcome to this exciting episode of Sattology debunking mythology.

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,520
Sattology means science of truth or study of truth.

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,800
Opposite of that is mythology which means science or study of fake lie or imagination.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,880
Sattology is made of two words Sat and Logo.

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,420
Sat is Sanskrit root word for Sat-Chit-Anand, truth.

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,840
And opposite of that is the myth, which

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,160
is also Sanskrit root word for fake lie or imagination.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,120
So combined with logos, it becomes

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,360
Satology versus Mythology.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,960
[SPEAKING HINDI]

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:01:03,960
So, let us welcome Professor Rameshwar Mishra Pankaj.

12
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Today's topic is a very interesting topic and people talk about it again and again.

13
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,960
So first I will touch on history a little bit.

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Even today, people call America, even though the settlers are Native American,

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,960
people still call this country a Judeo-Christian country.

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
and everyone accepts it,

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,960
whereas their population is only 45%.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Only 45%.

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,960
The majority of people in America are agnostic,

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
they call themselves atheists,

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,960
and if you say atheists,

22
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,960
it has a different connotation,

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,960
but they say that they are not affiliated with any religion.

24
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,960
And America calls itself a constitutional republic,

25
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
not a democracy.

26
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Constitutional Republic is the idea of Aristotle, which is a little different from his Guru,

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
different from Geocraty and Plato.

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,960
So, in India, it is said that we are secular.

29
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,960
If someone reads the word secular in America, he thinks that they are atheists.

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
This is what the Americans think.

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,960
And that is why the image of Indians has been created in America or in the world of the empire,

32
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,960
that they are atheists.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
That's why it can be easily converted.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:35,960
But Indian politicians, academicians or Indian citizens never contest this.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,960
They say that we are not secular.

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,960
And the left makes it a kind of a curse that these people are right wing fanatics.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,960
So the right wing fanatics of America are Christians, whose name is Christian country.

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:03:01,960
But India's right wing is a minority, even though it is a majority, and the left wing which is called secular is prominent.

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:10,960
Do you think that is why the Indian government ignores the Hindu struggle?

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:19,960
No, there are two different things. First, why do we ignore the struggle of Hindus? We will talk about this later.

41
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,960
First, why is this state system in India?

42
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,960
So, what happened was that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was with Japan and Germany

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,960
and he had declared Independent India in 1943.

44
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Swaraj and Swadesh were the two islands, he had a flag on them, a coin, a flag.

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,960
The minimum requirement for a sovereign state was fulfilled by the Britishers.

46
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,960
They had coins, national flag, national anthem.

47
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:05,960
They said that all these Indian territories are ours and the Britishers living here are strangers and outsiders.

48
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,960
They are outsiders and strangers.

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,960
They have no rights and it is our birthright to expel them.

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:30,960
But Germany was winning earlier, but later, for example, the Soviet army started beating Germany in many places, America came, it killed Japan, and the Indian soldiers protected the British soldiers in many places.

51
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:47,960
But before winning, they made a deal with Nehru and Gandhi ji, especially on Nehru's side, that we are very loyal, loyal because Jawaharlal Nehru had written a document.

52
00:04:47,960 --> 00:05:15,960
The transfer of power document is from the British Maharani Press. In that, in many sections, the transfer of power documents are written clearly that Jawaharlal has suggested that the soldiers should be trained and they should be given guerilla training.

53
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,960
and they will go to fight Subhash Ghosh in the French of Kohima.

54
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:28,960
So when a person went so far that he was ready to give the support of the British to fight against his own country's hero,

55
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,960
then the British thought that this is our truth and we should transfer the power to it.

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Because after transferring the power, they started doing it from 1917, they were scared of the first world war.

57
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
So, he was in search of a solution.

58
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Till then Lokmanya Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Bipin Chandra Pal, Raj Pihari Bose were there.

59
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
There were many patriots.

60
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Till then he thought that whatever has been made by us, we will spoil it.

61
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
So, he was waiting.

62
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,960
So, he told Gandhi ji from South Africa that you are a pacifist, you are on our side, so let's go to India and do politics.

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:13,960
So, Gandhi ji was brought from South Africa and slowly, Motilal Nehru and Gandhi ji became a big lobby.

64
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,960
And later, they made Jawaharlal Nehru the President, who had no interest in politics and no understanding.

65
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:30,960
So, seeing Jawaharlal Nehru's loyalty to the British Crown, he was transferred and empowered.

66
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,960
So, what they did was that they made the India Act 1935 the base for the document.

67
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,960
And the officer at that time, who was Rao, D.S. Rao or B.S. Rao,

68
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,960
the Rao's who prepared the India Act 1935 draft of 1935,

69
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
they were given the responsibility to make the constitution of India.

70
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
And to show that, they made a committee of the whole world.

71
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,960
So, this is how the government was brought in.

72
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:09,960
But still, at that time, the people of India were under so much pressure that they neither called the government of India secular nor socialist.

73
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
They called it the Sovereign Republic.

74
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:23,960
After this, when Lal Bahadur Shastri was forced to negotiate with Pakistan on the orders of the leaders of the Soviet Union in the Tashkent,

75
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,960
and then it felt that he should not go and go back from here, so he was killed there.

76
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Lal Bahadur Shastri ji, whose cause is being investigated, but has not been investigated yet.

77
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,960
So after that, on the signal of the Soviet Union, Indira Gandhi was made the Prime Minister of India

78
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,960
and after that the communists took over India.

79
00:07:47,960 --> 00:08:14,960
the Indira Gandhi's arrival. 1969 onwards. So, what happened with this is that the communist dominated state started to run. So, they, Indira Gandhi was very corrupt, very corrupt, corrupted and was arbitrary and the suffering of the people was increasing.

80
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,960
So, the movement of Jai Prakash Narayan started, which he called the Total Revolution Movement.

81
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,960
So, he put an emergency because he was scared of it.

82
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:32,960
And in the emergency, he put the threat of communists and on the orders of the communists, he amended the constitution.

83
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:41,960
And the sovereign democratic republic was made into a secular socialist democratic republic.

84
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:53,960
When was India made secular? In 1975 when there was no democracy, no republic.

85
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Now the whole context of secularism is Christianity.

86
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,960
When the Christian Churches did not fight among themselves, it was said that the state will remain secular.

87
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:14,960
But no society is secular. But in any major Christian nation in the world, secularism is not an adjective of state.

88
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:23,960
England is not a secular state, France is not a secular state, Germany is not a secular state, Holland, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal are not secular states.

89
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,160
and USA is not a secular state, they are all religious states.

90
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,960
And communist is also not a secular state,

91
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,960
that means USSR was not a secular state and China was not a secular state.

92
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:42,960
So it means that purposefully it was kept secular to bring it against Hinduism.

93
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,960
We are seeing the proof of this in Kerala, we will go into details there.

94
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:55,960
I will add one thing, in American constitution, American government can't directly donate to any church.

95
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,960
But what they have done is, they have made organizations in between, through which they donate to Christians.

96
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:13,960
I will give you an idea, around 70 billion dollars, which was given to Christian organizations only during Covid indirectly.

97
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,960
directly Indian government, American government didn't give, they gave through vehicles

98
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,960
and Islamic organizations in America, were given 7 to 8 billion dollars donation

99
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,960
but Hindu organizations were not given

100
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,960
and Hindus were also given indirectly, but all of them, none of them are directly connected to Hinduism

101
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:39,960
they were given only 1 or 2 billion dollars, but all of them are from social service organizations

102
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,960
There is no religion in that but rest of the groups are religious groups.

103
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,960
In this sense, you are saying a very important thing, but if I go into each and every branch, I may get lost in the subject, but let me say this.

104
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,960
The problem is that everyone knew who the Hindu was in Sanatan Dharma.

105
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Vedas are the main branch of Sanatan Dharma, apart from this, the Buddhists, Jains and later on the Sikhs, who believe in some or the other Panth,

106
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,960
i.e. the fruit of Karma and rebirth, every Karma has a possible fruit and it is reversed, it is rebirth,

107
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,960
This was the condition.

108
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:28,960
So, these people who are secular or who do not believe in religion are not Hindus.

109
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,960
But later, the RSS people got an inferiority that they made a world Hindu parishad

110
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:43,960
and in that they convinced some saints and gave a strange definition which was never there in India

111
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,960
that anyone who is born in a Hindu family and if he has not renounced Hinduism, then he is a Hindu.

112
00:11:50,960 --> 00:12:00,960
So, in this way, any communist, atheist, or any other religion who criticizes Hinduism, who abuses Vedas, who abuses Krishna,

113
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,960
who criticizes Jainism, who criticizes Buddhism, who does not even believe in Sikhs,

114
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:16,460
and those who do not believe in any religion and say that religion is all fake, that too is called Hindu.

115
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,960
This definition in Sanskrit is called "Svatovyahat" meaning "the one who breaks himself".

116
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,960
This means that the one who believes in Hindu religion and the one who works for the destruction of Hindu religion,

117
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,960
both are called Hindu by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

118
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,240
because they had an inferiority that everything happens with numbers.

119
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
So we increase our number.

120
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,640
And the situation is that the number of Muslims was very low after the partition,

121
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,920
but Muslims are dominating Indian politics.

122
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,080
The number of Christians was very low, but Christians are dominating.

123
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,040
So the number theory is clearly visible.

124
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
There were very few communists.

125
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
There are very few communists in India.

126
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,760
And they are dominating politics.

127
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
So what does the number mean?

128
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:09,760
and the one who destroys religion in the name of his number is also a Hindu and the one who follows religion is also a Hindu.

129
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
So this is the peak of foolishness.

130
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Which was not there anywhere till 15th August 1947.

131
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:23,760
It was that the livelihood of the lier and the atheist will be given the right of life.

132
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
But he will not be considered a religious person and a Hindu.

133
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,760
He is not a Hindu, he will be called a lier.

134
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,760
But the Vishwa Hindu Parishad gave a strange explanation of Hindutva due to their ignorance and ignorance.

135
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,760
So, one thing happened, they called both the destroyer of religion and the follower of religion as Hindus.

136
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,760
And here the state, during Indira Gandhi's time, the communists took over completely.

137
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,760
The result is that even in the name of Hindutva, like we will give to Muslims, to Christians,

138
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,760
So, the Hindus should also be given some funds by the government.

139
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,760
So, they have chosen the organizations that are against Hinduism and are against the destruction of Hinduism.

140
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,760
But since they were called Hindus according to the definition of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, they were given money.

141
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:18,760
That is, to spread Islam, they are giving money to Muslims through the consolidated fund of India.

142
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:28,760
The government treasury of India is used to fund the education of Islam and Christianity.

143
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:36,760
The consolidated fund of India, which is made up of the tax of Hindus,

144
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,760
is not used to fund the education of Hinduism.

145
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,760
On top of that, the atheists are also being funded in the name of Hinduism.

146
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,760
So this situation was created by the state. This situation was not even there in 15 August 1947.

147
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,760
So this is a very serious situation.

148
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,760
And what is happening because of this is that people are openly working against Hinduism.

149
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
But there is more to it.

150
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,760
And this is called false propaganda.

151
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
How does it work?

152
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Now, there is a problem in this.

153
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:24,760
The religious, learned, knowledgeable, intelligent Hindus did not form a party.

154
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Swami Karpatri ji did, but he was not aware of modern politics.

155
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,760
So, he was caught in his innocence.

156
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
There is a separate story about this.

157
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
It will take a long time to explain, so I will not tell you.

158
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,760
They were cheated. They were not allowed to succeed.

159
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,760
In the beginning, they had a very big impact on North India.

160
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,760
And after this, no religious, knowledgeable Hindu party was formed.

161
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,760
The party that was formed, it was RSS.

162
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Because it was emerging as a force, it seemed that there were a lot of people in it.

163
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,760
During the partition, its branches started to grow.

164
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Nehru, fearing that it would be a big power, banned it in the name of Gandhi's murder.

165
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
And then he suppressed it a lot.

166
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:21,760
You will see how Nehru killed Hindus in the name of Gandhi's murder.

167
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,760
But the main thing is that when RSS was banned, they created a party out of fear.

168
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,760
But in that party, no talk of protecting Hinduism was said.

169
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:43,760
because they were not religious and educated people. They were people who were working with the intention of gathering Hindus in the Sangh.

170
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,760
They did not have knowledge of religion, modern politics, so they did not talk about religion.

171
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,760
The result is that they did not have any knowledge of politics. We give two proofs of this.

172
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:08,760
There are many proofs, 50. First, according to any definition of religion, Gandhi cannot be called a non-violent.

173
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:18,760
And Gandhi himself is not a non-violent. How is he not? Gandhi wrote in both Harijan and Young India,

174
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,760
and he said that his definition of non-violence is not the one in Europe,

175
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
because non-killing is not non-violence,

176
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,760
but the definition of non-violence in Patanjali's Yog Sutra is what I believe.

177
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,760
So what is that definition?

178
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,760
"Sarvada Sarvatha Sarva-bhuteshu Anabhidroha Ahimsa"

179
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:48,760
"Sada Purna-tah Samast Praniyo Aur Pratitya Ke Tatvo Ke Prati Droha Ka Bhav"

180
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
"Maitri Ki Bhav Na Kaho Na Hi Ahimsa"

181
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,760
What is said about violence?

182
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Vitarka himsa-adayah krita-karita-anumodita lobha-krodha-moha-purvaka mridu-madhyaadhimatra duhkha-ajnana-ananta-phala iti pratipaksa-bhavanam 

183
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,760
There are three types of violence.

184
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,760
1. Krit, done by oneself.

185
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,760
2. Karai, done by others.

186
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,760
3. Anmodan, done by others.

187
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
These are the three types of violence.

188
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
After this, we have a deep analysis of everything here.

189
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,760
After that, it was said that it can be due to three reasons.

190
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Greed, anger or lust.

191
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Then it was said that there will be three more parts of it.

192
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Soft, medium or extreme.

193
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Soft, medium and extreme.

194
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,760
So, there are 81 types of violence.

195
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,760
So, according to that definition, Gandhi ji will be called violent.

196
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
because he killed Hindus by saying that poor Muslims were killing Hindus.

197
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,760
There was a riot in Moplah after the failure of the Khalifat movement.

198
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,760
So, the Moplahs killed Hindus there.

199
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Gandhiji gave him such a way that he teaches them their religion, that he is a poor brother.

200
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,760
So, what is this?

201
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,760
krita-karita-anumodita

202
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Gandhi ji himself did not kill the Hindus in Mopla, Kerala, but he got them killed and then he made them pay for it.

203
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:28,760
After this, in the partition, it was known that many people would die. Gandhi himself told Viceroy that "Let there be bloodbath."

204
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,760
The collected work of Mahatma Gandhi is there. I have given his page in my book.

205
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,760
Let there be bloodbath.

206
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,760
He knew that there will be bloodbath in large numbers.

207
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Then why didn't you arrange for the protection of Hindus?

208
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,760
So what is this? They are violent. Gandhi ji is not violent in any way.

209
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,760
And all the poets of the Sangh started saying that Gandhi ji's violence is very bad.

210
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,760
Then like fools, they started writing stories and writing articles that India has not been subdued by non-violence.

211
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,760
And then they imagined that this king was also a non-violent person.

212
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,760
And that Brihadrath was a non-violent person.

213
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
And that Sumitra Shung removed him.

214
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,760
False stories.

215
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,760
False stories in the name of history.

216
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
And not knowing what is right for a person.

217
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,760
You could have called Gandhiji a non-violent person.

218
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:31,760
You could have said that you talk about non-violence in war, but your actions are violent according to the scriptures, because you have made violence, it is done and tolerated.

219
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
I am telling you how much ignorance.

220
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Second, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote a letter to Gandhiji that war is going to happen soon in the world.

221
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,760
This was written when the Second World War had started and the Soviet Union was being attacked.

222
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,760
That soon there will be bloodshed in the world and at that time I will be with the communist party and the Soviet Union.

223
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:14,760
class war and class struggle. This is Jawaharlal Nehru's letter to Gandhi. So how did he become a pacifist? The one who is saying that the fire of violence will ignite, there will be a struggle and I will support the Soviet Union.

224
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:23,360
So, the Soviet Union made a plan that the subordinates of the Soviet bloc, the nation-states, will not keep an army.

225
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,760
They will talk about peace and if they face any problem, we will defend them.

226
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,360
So, they made a peace army everywhere.

227
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,760
This is a proposal of the Soviet Union, a communist international.

228
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,760
So, on the signal of the communist international, Jawaharlal Nehru talked about peace here.

229
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
The Sangh people said that he is a pacifist.

230
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,160
You give your enemy the wrong idea.

231
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,160
You consider Gandhi as a non-voilent and Jawaharlal Nehru as a pacifist.

232
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,160
This shows that he does not have political sense.

233
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Either he is a joint devotee of Gandhi, which I do not see.

234
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,160
If we assume that he has political sense,

235
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:11,160
then he will be accused of being an agent of Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.

236
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,160
or they had collusion, so I don't believe it.

237
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
That's why I'm saying that they are ignorant.

238
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Now, the Maoist party attacked Tibet.

239
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Jawaharlal Nehru stated in the parliament

240
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
that the Chinese soldiers are in great trouble,

241
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
so we are sending them rice,

242
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
we are sending them RATIONS,

243
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,160
and some soldiers as well.

244
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,160
That is, he sent an army and sent food.

245
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
For whom?

246
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Because they could not capture Tibet.

247
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,160
Neither were they familiar with the climate there, nor the mountains there.

248
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
So they never captured Tibet.

249
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Jawaharlal Nehru sent the Indian army and guided them to go from here and there.

250
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
And they captured Tibet.

251
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,160
At that time, Lohia called Nehru a traitor.

252
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
But the Sangh never said.

253
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:07,160
They say, "No, no, they are peaceful people and they are innocent."

254
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,160
So, these people are foolish.

255
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,160
Or they are very oppressed.

256
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,160
The result is that even after coming to power,

257
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,160
they did not remove the word "socialist" and "secularist" that were used in the emergency.

258
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,160
But it is not just about this.

259
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,160
Now, let's come to your main question.

260
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Why are Hindus being killed and why do they do this?

261
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Jawaharlal Nehru was clear that he wanted to bring communist rule in India, but he was a bit smart.

262
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,160
He thought that he would not murder like Stalin.

263
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,160
One reason for this was that the caste system in India was very strong.

264
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,160
And that was a blessing for us, our strength.

265
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:03,160
So, because of the caste system, if you kill some people of a particular caste, then the rest of the people of that caste will take revenge on you.

266
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,160
This is true till 15th August 1947.

267
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Because people of all the castes of India were warriors.

268
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,160
In the army, people of all the castes of India were in the army.

269
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:19,160
All of them, Raman, Kshatriya, Vaishya and the ones who are called Shudras, they all were in the army.

270
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,160
You see, during Janak's time, all kinds of armies were there.

271
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:28,420
So, all the people of India are warriors, soldiers, and soldiers.

272
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,340
If you kill their people, they will kill you.

273
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,660
In Russia, the farmer was poor.

274
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,900
He was poor since the time of Jarr.

275
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,100
So, when the communists made the farmers laborers,

276
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,580
through collectivization of agriculture,

277
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,380
they took away the farms of the farmers.

278
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,860
They couldn't do anything.

279
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,900
If the farms were taken away in India, there would have been a murder.

280
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,100
So, Jawaharlal Nehru was very smart.

281
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,780
He thought he would slowly get the check-bonding done and do a lot of such things.

282
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,120
He said about cooperative farming.

283
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,180
He was bringing communism slowly.

284
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,500
So, that's why he got him killed.

285
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,840
Then he considered RSS as his enemy.

286
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:18,920
As soon as he heard about Gandhi's murder, he let it go.

287
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:26,060
In a way, indirectly permitted that Gandhi may be murdered.

288
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,060
There were attemp of murdering Gandhi earlier as well

289
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Jawaharlal knew about it.

290
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,060
And he killed those people later.

291
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,060
So, the secret police did not follow them and did not try to catch them.

292
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,060
This means that Gandhi was allowed to be killed by Jawaharlal Nehru.

293
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Let there be the murder of Mahatma Gandhi.

294
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,560
because he was coming in their way.

295
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,060
So, he was in this state.

296
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,060
The next day, without any proof, without any FIR,

297
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,060
he was given the RSS, Savarkar, Hindu Mahasabha.

298
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:06,060
And then in Maharashtra and in some parts of Gujarat

299
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,060
and in some parts of Madhya Pradesh, like at the house of Biryan Kumar Saklecha,

300
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:16,060
So, he killed the Brahmins and other Hindus who supported the Sangh.

301
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,060
He made stone in their houses, used sticks, set fire.

302
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
This is how he killed the Hindus.

303
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:29,060
In return for Gandhi's murder, Jawaharlal Nehru, or his government, if he cannot be called personal,

304
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,060
his party members killed the Hindus.

305
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,060
After this, Hindus were killed in Kashmir, we all know.

306
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:45,060
After this, in Bengal, Hindus are being killed, and the Indian Jantar Party's own activists are being killed.

307
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:53,060
They don't say anything. In Assam, Nagaland, Hindus were killed, and then slowly, slowly, they were converted into Christians.

308
00:26:53,060 --> 00:27:00,060
Now, Nagaland, Manipur, and Meghalaya are not secular states, they are religious states. They are Christian states.

309
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:07,060
De facto. Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Manipur is not yet done and Mizoram.

310
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,060
Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram, they are de facto Christian state.

311
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,060
They are not secular state. But Indian government is still secular.

312
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:22,060
And the bigger thing is, now we have to see what is their problem,

313
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,060
but the bigger thing is that the people who are important in our constitution,

314
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:47,060
In the emergency, Indira Gandhi had made a very strong point that the fundamental duties of Indian citizens are in Article 51 of the Constitution.

315
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:54,060
It is good that they will work to protect the unity and integrity of the country.

316
00:27:54,060 --> 00:28:00,060
They will work for sovereignty and integrity of their country.

317
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:06,060
If it is said that they will work for the protection of the country, then they will work for the protection of the country.

318
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:24,060
But the 51(e) which is called A, B, C, D, 51(d) means the part of Constitution 4(a)

319
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:44,260
Article 51(d) says that to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst

320
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:51,060
all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities.

321
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Common brotherhood is the fundamental duty of every citizen.

322
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:18,060
So when in India, a Christian preacher or a Muslim propagandist publicly says that your God is weak, Krishna is weak, Christ is powerful or your Ram and Krishna are weak,

323
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,060
It is a disgrace to Krishna's and Rama's character.

324
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,060
And our Allah is powerful.

325
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
So what is this doing?

326
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,060
This is the fundamental duty to promote brotherhood.

327
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,060
It is obstructing that.

328
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:38,060
And if any Indian citizen obstructs brotherhood,

329
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,060
obstructs it, puts obstacles in it,

330
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,060
then he is violating the fundamental duty.

331
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:48,300
The basic duty of an Indian citizen is being violated.

332
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,180
So, his citizenship should be terminated.

333
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:58,140
So, if anyone in India says that only Christian religions are superior,

334
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,220
Hinduism is inferior, Hindu gods and goddesses are inferior,

335
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,740
and Hinduism is criticized by Hindu scriptures,

336
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,100
then at the same time, his citizenship should be taken away.

337
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:18,600
He is not eligible to be a citizen of India because he violates Article 51, which is the fundamental duty of an Indian citizen.

338
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
But state did nothing.

339
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:36,600
He went to Kerala and Bengal and in the whole country, Muslim and Christian propagandists publicly say that Hindu religion is inferior, Hindu gods are bad, their character is bad.

340
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,600
and they permit this.

341
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
So, in this way, the rulers of India

342
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,600
are violating the constitution of India.

343
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Because the fundamental duties

344
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
of the citizens who do not do these duties should be abolished.

345
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,600
So, why are these BJP people not protecting the citizens of India?

346
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Why are they not protecting brotherhood, the feeling of brotherhood, the feeling of brotherhood?

347
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Instead of that, for the majority of the Indian society, spreading hatred, malice, and malice is public.

348
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
This is all public in India.

349
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
So this is a terrible thing, isn't it?

350
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,600
So why are they doing this?

351
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,600
The BJP and RSS people should tell us.

352
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,900
But the question is, are there at least 100 crore Hindus in India,

353
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,280
and there is no group of educated, well-educated, religiously knowledgeable,

354
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,280
enlightened Hindus, who can form a Hindu party?

355
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:47,780
We must follow this constitution, because the BJP government is violating Article 51 of this constitution.

356
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Congress has done it, now the BJP is doing it.

357
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,980
Where is the common brotherhood?

358
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,980
As soon as you abuse other's religion, other's deity, then communal brotherhood is over.

359
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,980
You are violating article 51.

360
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,980
I don't know why they don't do it, but they are doing it continuously.

361
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,980
This means that their...

362
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,980
...equality of religions is not pure.

363
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Giving prominence to Hindu religion is a different matter.

364
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
Right?

365
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Giving importance to Hindu religion, we don't know when it will come.

366
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:23,980
Hinduism does not consider Islam and Christianity equal. Instead, it gives funds to both.

367
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:30,980
And the Hindus who are atheists, i.e. the things which are not Hindu,

368
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:34,980
initially, Vishwendu Parishad called them Hindus by using a false definition.

369
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Because a socialist and Marxist cannot be a Hindu by any definition.

370
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,980
The one who talks about eating cow meat cannot be a Hindu by any definition.

371
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:56,980
The British have a record of the Gauraksha movement from 1890 to 1900. I have written a book on the history of India in the India Office Library.

372
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:08,980
The British Queen has written in the book that the Gauraksha movement is a movement of awakening of Hindus and that we will be driven out of India.

373
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:18,980
Why? Because on the question of cow protection Arya Samajis, Murthy Pujars, Sanatan Dharmis, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, all are one.

374
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,980
This is the letter of Queen Victoria to the Viceroy.

375
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Cow protection is a principle in which Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Sanatan Dharmis and Arya Samajis are all one.

376
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,980
This is a very big issue.

377
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,980
BJP has not even raised such a big issue.

378
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,980
Jawaharlal was a Hindu traitor.

379
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,980
But BJP claims that he is a Hindu.

380
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:50,980
And they bring foreign currency from Gaumansk.

381
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,980
This is a great sin.

382
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,980
The government that takes money from Gaumansk is a sinner.

383
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
According to the Indian scriptures.

384
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
This is a great sin.

385
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,980
What do you do with foreign currency from the government?

386
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,980
You reduce your expenses, ask from the people of India.

387
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Chanakya has said that if the government needs it, it should ask the citizens for it.

388
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,980
The word 'pranay' has a meaning of 'gain' but he said that we should ask for more money.

389
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,980
If you are honest and cut down on your expenses,

390
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,980
not that the government should spend endlessly and ask the citizens for money.

391
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:37,980
If you are simple minded, from Prime Minister to Minister, to Chief Minister to Apsar, you should be simple minded, with less expenditure and then you can ask for money from citizens and they will give you.

392
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,980
But if you are selling cow meat and taking money, then you are a great sinner.

393
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:52,980
In 16th century I remember a conversation between Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Kazi written by Krishnadas Goswami.

394
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:01,980
I have not read all the Vedas carefully and I don't have quotations.

395
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Many viewers have quotations.

396
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says that killing cows is not a part of Vedas.

397
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,980
It is not written anywhere.

398
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:18,980
But some Rig Vedic people who have a communist mindset have translated it wrongly.

399
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,980
People have misunderstood that in Vedas also people ate cow meat, even Indra ate cow meat.

400
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,980
No, but in that, the sense of authority is important.

401
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,980
One should decide who is whose authority.

402
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,980
If I say that the one who is murdered is a communist, then will they accept that he is a communist?

403
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Yes, that is the right logic.

404
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:45,980
If I am not an authority about communism, then how can any Christian be an authority about the Vedas?

405
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:52,980
Communist is not an authority, he is an unauthorised person, he must be punished, he or she.

406
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,980
So, it is the duty of the Indian government to punish those who misinterpret the Vedas.

407
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,980
In many Vedas, it is said, in the Merik book, all the principles are there, the principles of Sanskrit, Kashmita, Goma, etc.

408
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,980
Those who lie about the Vedas, about the scriptures, they are criminals, not punishable, but criminals.

409
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:13,980
And this is also according to this, they condemn the common brotherhood.

410
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,980
So, even this constitution can punish if the government's intention is good.

411
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,980
I believe that the intention of the Sangh, BJP and Modi Ji is not good.

412
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,980
And if the intention is good, then he is a coward.

413
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,980
And see, the coward has been condemned a lot here.

414
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
You have read Mahabharata.

415
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,980
What does Vidula say to his son?

416
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,980
When he comes back from the battlefield, he says that the coward is not a son.

417
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,980
He is a 'Purish' meaning a 'Mutra' (a male)

418
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:52,980
This is in Mahabharata. If a prince is a 'Kair' then he is a 'Mutra' not a 'Putra' (a male)

419
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,980
He has also come out of the 'Yoni' path and 'Mutra' also comes out. So, he is not a 'Putra' but a 'Mutra'

420
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,980
So, this is the standard of India. If a ruler is a 'Kair' then he is a 'Mutra'

421
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,980
Then he is not a human being.

422
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,980
Why are they afraid? Why are they afraid of following the constitution? Why are they afraid of following the constitution?

423
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,980
We will have to see. Why are they afraid of protecting Hindu Dharma?

424
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:21,980
The rest are not afraid of correcting their enemies. They are afraid of protecting Hindu Dharma.

425
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,980
So, they should decide for themselves. I have already told you what is Mahabharata.

426
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:33,980
No, it is a very low feeling. Always looking at others, not understanding about yourself.

427
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:38,980
One should take inspiration from others but for that also we need to have a character.

428
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,980
What kind of character? Is it good or bad?

429
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,980
And in Bhagwat Purana the definition is very clear.

430
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Those who believe in Vedas are the religious. Those who are against Vedas are not religious.

431
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,980
But Vedas are a book of...

432
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:01,980
It is a book of the world which defines a common law.

433
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,980
It is a golden standard.

434
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,980
You will attain salvation only by approaching it.

435
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,980
If you go against it, you will go away from salvation.

436
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,980
But any government...

437
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,980
We are talking about the social level.

438
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:22,980
But no Indian government in the world talks about Sanatan Dharma on the basis of Vedas.

439
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,980
They talk about Sanatan Dharma with the mindset of secularism, with the mindset of Aristotle.

440
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,980
He is a Greek philosopher and Yavan is our Shastra.

441
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,980
We are translating it through the medium of Yavan in today's common law.

442
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,980
So, there will be unrest in that.

443
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:51,980
One last question, we have seen many Hindu leaders who call themselves Hindu leaders, they talk about this.

444
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:04,980
The attacks against Hindus are happening everywhere, in Bengal, Kerala, people don't tell but it is happening in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh.

445
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,980
is happening there as well and nobody is talking about it. Media is not aware of it and you

446
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:18,980
are right that such people should be punished. So, what should such people do in today's

447
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:25,980
society, what should youth do, so that they do not have to suffer so much of 'Avahilna'

448
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,980
What should people do, what should youth do in today's society,

449
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:33,980
that they don't have to suffer so much of 'Avahilna'

450
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,980
because all the laws, a little Hindu youth will be awakened,

451
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,980
he is shut down in SC/ST Act. I have heard it many times from people.

452
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,980
I don't live in India, but I have heard it.

453
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,980
So what should such a youth do?

454
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,980
No, we will have to try in many ways.

455
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,980
The most powerful person in the world,

456
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,980
is not an inspiration to make a political party.

457
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,980
If he is not, then Owesi has called its Muslim youth

458
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,980
to become a constitutional expert.

459
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,980
While in reality, this constitution instructs to control Islam.

460
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,980
In the constitution it is written to control everything that attacks the majority.

461
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,980
So, Hindus or people who are sitting in America or anywhere,

462
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Read this constitution carefully.

463
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:32,980
As I said, there are many reasons for which the government is responsible for protecting Hindu religion.

464
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,980
And there is no reason to suppress the majority religion in the world in democracy.

465
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,980
And this was not even in the constitution.

466
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,980
Congress has misinterpreted it and made it arbitrary.

467
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,980
So, first of all, the people of the Sangh/RSS-BJP

468
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,980
say that the constitution is wrong.

469
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,980
And after that, they even pay homage to the constitution.

470
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,980
This constitution is like this.

471
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,980
And then when you reach the door of the parliament,

472
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,980
you pay homage to the constitution.

473
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,980
You pay homage to that parliament,

474
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,980
and on the other hand, you also pay homage to Gandhi ji.

475
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
You pay homage to that parliament,

476
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,980
which Gandhi ji used to call 'Vishya' and 'Bandh'.

477
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:21,980
So, the main thing is that it is anarchy, materialism is uncivilized and thought is virtuous.

478
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,980
So, the people sitting outside, especially those who are outside,

479
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,980
they should first awaken their materialism, practice wisdom.

480
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:35,980
If possible, make a learning center like this, which studies and trains people on Indian politics.

481
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,980
I have been saying this for many years, it should be a knowledge center.

482
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:48,980
There should be 1-2 such centres where it is told what is happening in the world, what is happening in India and how wrong it is.

483
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:56,980
One more point here, we will have to do publicity, so that we have truth in propaganda too.

484
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Now we should not say that we will have to improve the language.

485
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,980
Like I do not agree with the fact that they are inspired by foreigners and look at other's faces. Not at all.

486
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:19,980
They intentionally do what makes them inferior, what they call 'Yogai Bhuma Tatsukam' which is great, great, big, this is inferiority.

487
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,980
How? What inspiration do they get from England?

488
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:29,980
In England, the crown is the official legal patron of the Protestant Church.

489
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,980
So, you take inspiration from England, brother.

490
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,980
and the English language is the majority language of the British Empire,

491
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,980
so how did you get inspired by England?

492
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:47,980
Neither did you give official legal protection to the majority religion,

493
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
nor did you patronize it,

494
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,980
whereas the English crown is the official legal patron of the Protestant Church.

495
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,980
Nor did you make the Indian language Sanskrit.

496
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:03,980
If you leave Hindi, then develop a language in which Hindi, Marathi, Bangla, Tamil, Gujarati, all have common words.

497
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,980
Develop such a language, work a little.

498
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,980
So do something for India, they are not even copying the countries of the world, so you cannot say that they are inspiring.

499
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,980
Now see, why don't you get inspired from America?

500
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:23,980
You can get inspired from America by the government's farm, or you can get inspired by England.

501
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:28,980
So the president should have an official legal pattern of Hindu religion.

502
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,980
Because there is an official legal pattern of the Crown Protestant Church.

503
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:39,980
Or if you take America, when the president changes in America, the whole secretariat changes.

504
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:45,980
So this bureaucracy should not have so much power that it keeps changing the leaders.

505
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:54,980
Suppose they want to be secular in any sense, then they should make at least three parishes.

506
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:00,980
First of all, they should make a great parish of Sanatan Dharma and give it official recognition.

507
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,980
Second, they should say that since another country has been formed in the name of Islam,

508
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,980
then it is necessary to make something called Indian Islam.

509
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:18,980
Third, make India a Church of India. If this is the case, like the king of England made the Church of England,

510
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:28,980
apart from the Pope, so he says that there will be a Church of England and any Christian in India will have to show allegiance to the Church of India.

511
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:38,980
So it will be in their control. You make a Church of India, make a Sanatan Dharma Mahaparishad and tell the Muslims that India will be a Mahaparishad of Muslims.

512
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,980
There should be some control of the government. You are not secular in that sense either.

513
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,980
And the fund thing was very important.

514
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Churches are still funded by the Government of India and all the state governments.

515
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,980
In the name of relief to the whole world.

516
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,980
So, they fund churches, they fund Muslim organizations.

517
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:11,980
So, they are not secular, they are not religious, they are people who spread arbitrariness and anarchy.

518
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,980
We have to say something against them.

519
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,980
So, people in America and abroad should say the truth.

520
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,980
It is not necessary that you are politically aggressive.

521
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,980
But, create learning centres in a very peaceful manner.

522
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Spread the truth from there that what is happening.

523
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:33,480
India is not as unjust as India is.

524
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,980
So, we have to adopt a strategy in many ways.

525
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,480
I would say to them to make a Church of India.

526
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,480
So, all the Christians in India will be loyal to Church of India.

527
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
It cannot be against England.

528
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,980
It cannot be against Sweden or America.

529
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,980
Everyone will have to register as Church of India.

530
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:15,980
There will be control. In India, there are American, English, Scottish, Welsh and Switzerland churches. There are 50 churches working together. What is happening? Or you can say that this is an open field, let the Hindus also play.

531
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,980
Actually the concept of nation state is bad.

532
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,980
The concept of nation state is a European concept.

533
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,980
We will do another show on this.

534
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,980
India is being called a civilizational state.

535
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,980
People are not understanding this.

536
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,980
They are saying something new.

537
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,980
In English it is called civilization.

538
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,980
It is a phrase.

539
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,980
It is a phrase.

540
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,980
In the world, there is no place where phraseology is used to run politics.

541
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,980
Phraseology is a cover for politics.

542
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,980
This means that the people who are saying this, we will talk about it next time,

543
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,980
they are covering something.

544
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,980
They are hiding something. Because this is phraseology.

545
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,980
They have never defined what is civilizational state.

546
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,980
If that is the case, then say that it is a Hindu nation, civilization is Hindu.

547
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,980
They don't have honesty.

548
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:12,980
They have no interest in the civilizational state. They are coining phrasers.

549
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,980
The phrasiology is being played by the leaders of India since 1947.

550
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,980
Nehru did it, Indira did it, remove poverty.

551
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,980
Now their grandson says that poverty has not been removed yet.

552
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,980
There should be some rule of law that if the party that announces,

553
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,980
if it does not follow it, then its people should be compensated for every loss.

554
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,980
So, it should be compensated and punished.

555
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,980
Rahul Gandhi can be blamed for this only if India does the right thing

556
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,980
that your party said to remove poverty, why are you still talking about poverty?

557
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,980
This is a criminal offence because you are deceiving, you are betraying and disowning your party's manifesto.

558
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,980
But the one who does it should be the ruler, not the ruler.

559
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,980
The problem is that BJP's rule is the rule of cowards.

560
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,980
Look, people will believe it is bad but I am a Brahmin and my job is to speak the truth.

561
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,980
BJP's rule is the rule of cowards. That's why all his thoughts are futile.

562
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,980
He will not get any result.

563
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,980
So, leave aside Klaibyu, there should be someone who can say Klaibyam Maasam Gamah Bharat.

564
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:23,980
There should be someone who can say Klaibyam Maasam Gamah Narendra Modi.

565
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:31,980
This is an example of atheism that they will make a different version of Cleibhiv.

566
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,980
They will say Cleibhiv means not to steal. The basic meaning is to be unknowing.

567
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:49,980
It literally means, you are telling me on the basis of Sanskrit, it literally means to shrink.

568
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:55,980
It also has the meaning that if a man's senses shrink then he cannot do anything.

569
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:03,980
But there it is not saying Arjuna in that sense because his senses were not shrinking.

570
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:11,980
The mind is restricted and the body is not.

571
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,980
Our Shashaks are restricted by mind and intellect.

572
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,980
It is possible that body is very hungry and lustful but mind and intellect are restricted.

573
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,980
So, we should awaken the power in mind and intellect.

574
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:27,980
Body has a lot of power but mind and intellect does not.

575
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:39,980
In Sanskrit, the word 'Klab' means 'concentrated' or 'concentrated' in Sanskrit.

576
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:44,980
So physical napunjak is different from mental and physical napunjak.

577
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,980
Krishna knows what kind of a person Arjuna is, so he won't say anything.

578
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,980
It means something else, because he is different.

579
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:03,980
Arjuna was not hijara or impotent. He was showing his mind and intellect at that time. His mind was shrinking or going into klyva state.

580
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,980
Thank you so much Rameshwar ji. People who are watching, please subscribe, like and share widely.

581
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:19,980
This is such an important conversation. In this, each point that Rameshwar ji has said, there is deep research, there is a book.

582
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,980
And send me the link of your book. If there is any link, I will share it with everyone.

583
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:30,980
And if everyone gets the links of his books in the community notes, then you can buy and read it.

584
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,980
And the book that he wrote on cows, I am going to buy it myself quickly.

585
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:42,980
I want to see Vedic references and use them.

586
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,980
Thank you very much.

587
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,980
It was published by Sitaram Goyal ji in the book 'Biblia Impacts - Viceroyalty of India'

588
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,980
She had published it herself.

589
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,980
She had read it through and through.

590
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:03,980
If you don't know about Sitaram Goyal ji, you can search about her and you will know who she is.

591
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:11,980
He is considered as a great Hindu and he has done many kind of researches.

592
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:18,980
And also in our tradition, many of our Acharyas like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Madhavacharya, Ramamrithacharya,

593
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,980
who are the people of tradition, they also have such writings. You can read them also.

594
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,980
There are many good scholars in Shankaracharyas.

595
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:34,980
Like Shankaracharya of 143rd Govardhan Math and other Shankaracharyas of Kanchi Math.

596
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,980
And many of their great sons and great grandsons have come to our show.

597
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,980
You can read them too. There are many books.

598
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,980
Thank you very much. Namaste. We will meet again in the next show.

599
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:47,980
Namaste.
