00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Namaste and welcome to this exciting new episode of Saptology debunking mythology.


00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.440
Saptology means science of truth or study of truth.


00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.400
Opposite of that is mythology which means science or study of fake lie or imagination.


00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.800
Thank you so much for liking our videos and subscribing to it in such big numbers.

is coming out, will be out shortly maybe and he will also be the part of our Lit Fest,


00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.320
and autographed by him. So let us welcome Dr. Ankit Shah.


00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840
Namaste. Namaste.


00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.840
Namaste.


00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.840
Ye duniya mein chal kya raha hai?


00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.840
Ye question hai sabko.


00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.280
Chal kya raha hai abhi?


00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.000
So now, France has openly said that they want to move away from the unipolar world.


00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.160
And secondly, we have seen that other countries in Europe also opposing the war and Russia


00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.880
seems to be closing the war.


00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.680
And by the time American weapons reach, the war will be over.


00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.560
So tell me in detail what's going on right now.


00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.600
So We have seen how Ukrainian Officials from the ministries


00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.120
are visiting Delhi.


00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.280
And they are talking How


00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.520
India can have a role in establishing peace talks


00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.240
and stuff like that.


00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.200
So I think the Ukrain have exhausted due to what is going on to some extent 


00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.720
But I think that until the objectives of this conflict are not completed,


00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.720
the war will continue.


00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.120
And because it is scripted, it is very clear.


00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.000
So you will see how the crisis events of the West


00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.920
will have to be pulled to justify it.


00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:23.920
But, as per what is seen, I feel that before the G20 summit in September, India should


00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.920
want to reach a consensus on peace talks, at least, and reach a conclusion.


00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.920
Right?


00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.920
Before the leaders' summit.


00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.920
So, in that direction, we see how the Ukrainian officials have come to Delhi and they are


00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.920
They are saying that India's role is to be Vishwa Guru and kind of buttering..


00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.920
Let's see if there is a solution.


00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.920
They have also invited our National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to Ukraine.


00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.920
Let's see what happens next.


00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.920
But this whole direction,


00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.920
in which I tell you how the currency's reset, banking crisis, sovereign debt crisis,


00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920
all this is visible ahead.


00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:16.920
So you will see that the wave of decolonization that I told you about and what I have predicted


00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:24.920
is that by 2025-2026, whatever capital trimming of Western assets is going to happen under


00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.920
this reset, which is highly inflated because of reserve currency bubble, this bubble is


00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920
going to burst.


00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.920
You can see the example of how big properties, I had tweeted that they are being sold at


00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.520
being sold at half the price.


00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:47.520
So, there are some comments that these cycles are going on, but this is not that cycle.


00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.520
According to me, this is that permanent capital trimming, which is a very natural thing when


00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.520
the reserve currency bubble bursts.


00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:04.520
So, a lot of real estate properties, especially commercial ones, will be seen empty.


00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.120
It is possible that some commercial properties may be converted into housing etc.


00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.400
So you will see this in the West.


00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.560
Along with that, you will see the UK's properties which are very inflated will also come down.


00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560
There will be issues in pension funds.


00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.520
So all these inflated assets of the West will come down this year.


00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.160
and we are seeing that in the wave of decolonization,


00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.640
Emmanuel Macron of France and I have told you that there is a cut in socialist freebies in all western economies


00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.640
because in this way, endless printing of currency will not be possible


00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.720
once we go into the pegged currency world.


00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.320
So, we saw in France that they started with the pension reform.


00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.560
So, because of that, the protest started in France, which has now become very aggravated.


00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:09.440
And, somewhere, Emmanuel Macron also understands that after the exit of Afghanistan,


00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.200
many nationalist leaders of Europe understood that it was a fake war on terror.


00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.160
There was no real war on terror.


00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.800
and that's why, you know, the protests, Macron had an understanding that


00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:38.800
maybe this protest is being organized by some western elements,


00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.800
so he also put some income tax rates on the big banks,


00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.800
from where he thinks it was being organized.


00:05:46.800 --> 00:06:01.800
So we saw this opposition and then Macron went to China. I think he is now very exhausted from this NATO alliance and fake war on terror and Ukraine script etc.


00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.800
France is clearly understanding that it is like a sandwich between Russia and the USA.


00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:16.800
He visited China and met Xi Jinping for 4-5 hours.


00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.800
After that, he made a big deal out of Taiwan.


00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.800
Almost like saying that what is our relation with him.


00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.800
That kind of a tone.


00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.800
And then you also saw that he used a word which is very interesting.


00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.800
He said Strategic Autonomy.


00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.800
The word strategic autonomy is used only by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs.


00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:48.800
The interesting thing to see here is that the Chinese leadership is Xi Jinping.


00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.800
Because we are seeing a lot of reports that China is a replacement, China is a new global power,


00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Yuan can replace dollar. We are reading a lot of these reports in the mainstream media.


00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:13.440
I don't believe this because I have already put a question mark on it that Yuan cannot be a good store of value.


00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:21.840
So if Yuan is not a good store of value to save any nation in its reserves,


00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:29.040
everyone will be ready for the transaction because China is a manufacturing giant and supplies everyone.


00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.040
So, everything is ready for trade in Yuan and bilateral currencies.


00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:43.740
But when it comes to saving, then Yuan is not a good store of value.


00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.040
Why? Because its transparency is in question mark.


00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:58.040
If Yuan was so strong that it could replace the dollar and all the nations would trust it,


00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.320
then there was no need to make a BRICS currency.


00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.700
The very fact that BRICS currency is working on formula


00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.200
means that


00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.200
and digital yuan has been launched for 3-4 years


00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.860
it's such a big failure.


00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.200
What I said that no country


00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.200
will want to keep in savings


00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.200
it will want to get rid of it immediately.


00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.200
Some yuan has been collected, they will immediately purchase some and empty it.


00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.800
So if it is not a good store of value


00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.800
then it is not for savings and if it is not for savings then it's not a reserve currency.


00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:45.800
So I feel that Macron used the word strategic autonomy for Xi Jinping, which was also for the US on Taiwan issue.


00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.800
Europe wants to adopt strategic autonomy in the future, neither according to China nor according to America.


00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.800
So basically he is saying that we will act according to India.


00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.800
Because terminology is also the same, strategic autonomy.


00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.800
And I had predicted this last year itself that France has offered that partnership to India.


00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.800
No questions asked.


00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.800
Whatever you say, whatever you do.


00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.800
And this has happened because in Afghanistan, after being a fool for 20 years,


00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.800
a war on terror was going on.


00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.800
The way the Taliban got a red carpet welcome and left.


00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.800
And then how the submarine deals in Aukus were snatched from France.


00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.800
So this is all unraveled. France is now very clear that they have become very stupid.


00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.800
This NATO and EU and the alliance West collective.


00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.800
And not just that, Macron has also put a question mark on the dollar.


00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.800
So, let's see how much Xi Jinping will get,


00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.800
whether he is the leader of Gulf countries,


00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.800
because Xi Jinping went to Gulf countries for 3 days for Arab Summit,


00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.800
to check that if I decouple from West,


00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.800
then how much commitment I will get,


00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.800
and I got to know that he got 30 billion,


00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800
30 billions, which is just peanuts.


00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.800
So, wherever Xi Jinping or American leadership will go,


00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:19.360
that no matter where you are, whether it is Africa, the big nations of the UK or the nations


00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.960
of the Indian subcontinent, you will hear the same voice from everywhere and that is


00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.960
India.


00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:30.680
And there is a very clear reason for this that trust and transparency are the two things


00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.840
that only Indian diplomacy has been able to show.


00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.840
If you are an American ally, then how much can you trust, the allies know.


00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:50.840
If you are trading with China, you know that how can you keep the digital yuan in reserve currency, no matter how much you trade.


00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.840
You don't know what will be the fluctuation and manipulation.


00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:00.840
So I think the way Macron used the word strategic autonomy,


00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.840
the way the Prime Minister used the term Voice of Global South Summit,


00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:11.740
and the way the currency of BRICS is working


00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.400
I don't think Yuan can replace the dollar


00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.940
Now we are talking about the world of pegged currency


00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.860
or what is called fiat currency


00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.260
so any currency has its valuation on three things


00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.260
one is


00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.040
that the component of pegged commodities


00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.040
in that currency.


00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.040
Second is that


00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.040
how productive


00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.040
is your population


00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.040
and what kind of product


00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.040
can it make that the world needs


00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.040
at competitive rate.


00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.040
And the third part is the evaluation


00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.040
of currency that


00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.040
what is the global demand of that currency.


00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.040
Right. One portion


00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.040
of which is


00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.040
whether countries want to keep it in savings or not.


00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.040
Second is whether they want to keep it for trade or not.


00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:15.040
So we will see that as soon as this whole pegged currency goes into the world, the West will not be able to afford to purchase from Asia.


00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:27.040
Because there are natural resources and reserves, but the population is so productive that to be able to make such a product, which can be given to the world at competitive pricing,


00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040
...


00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:34.040
almost zero . because we havent seen much from west other than Defance or Tech.


00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:39.040
or deface maximum use..


00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.040
because I dont think 


00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.040
many of those world war experts


00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040
were started accepting de dollarization


00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.040
were now saying world war is about to happen..


00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.760
They don't even know that if America had the capacity to wage war with Russia and China,


00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.720
then there was no need for this fake Ukrainian conflict.


00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:08.840
So the very fact that this Ukrainian conflict is going on, means that de-dollarization will


00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.960
be given a free pass.


00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.400
So we are seeing that defense is not needed anymore.


00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:22.900
I mean, okay, if someone is taking US weapons, then what is the kind of trustworthiness in terms of supply?


00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.900
When crisis comes, will we get supply or not?


00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.900
Sometimes we talk about sanctioning allies, in the morning we talk about sanctioning,


00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.900
in the afternoon we talk about strategic partnership,


00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.900
and in the evening we say that supply is an issue of human rights and minority.


00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.400
So, this instability in policies that we see in the West,


00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.400
and because of that, even if they have good technology weapons,


00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.400
their economy is not able to function.


00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.400
As far as the last portion is concerned,


00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.400
the productivity of the population,


00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.400
we have discussed this many times before,


00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.400
that these people have destroyed the family institutions


00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.400
by giving socialist freebies.


00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.400
So, that productivity will come,


00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.400
if they can make something on Asian competitive pricing to sell,


00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.840
It will take a decade for manufacturing and supply chains.


00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.560
And what I predicted that all mines are coming out.


00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.920
Now India has declared that rare earth minerals have also been found.


00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.000
So all these are coming out because they want to peg the currency.


00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So now we have to tell what is there.


00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.200
Till now all the nations had hidden it.


00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.600
It will come in public that I have so many reserves.


00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.600
because now the currency will be pegged. It's a simple thing.


00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:45.600
You mentioned, there is an arrogance type in the American State Department.


00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.600
First, the kids make state policy and they have no idea.


00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.600
They have all studied from Berkeley and have come from here, from all the leftist institutions.


00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.600
In fact, Harvard is the most leftist, almost communist.


00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.600
and they are still living in the old cold war mentality.


00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.600
In 1945 we made France independent, why is France speaking against us?


00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.600
This is what they are asking.


00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.600
They are asking why people think the way they think.


00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.600
This is the actual question. Why are they thinking like this?


00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:23.600
So, what is to be told for that American arrogance?


00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:31.600
I think as soon as the economic might goes, the colonial hangover will also go away.


00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600
This is what I see it.


00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.600
Because it has become a habit to release indexes and reports on everyone.


00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:47.600
Collect criminals from every country, then release a report that the judicial system of that country is bad.


00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.600
and the criminal ran away.


00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600
So they collect the reports and then


00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.600
report that the judicial system


00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.600
is bad in that country.


00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.600
So all this is very cheap


00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.600
and everyone knows


00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600
that these things are happening.


00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600
From everywhere


00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.600
collect Vijay, Malaya, Nirav,


00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.600
Modi and all of them


00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.600
and then report


00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.600
that your judicial system is weak,


00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.600
your financial system is weak,


00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.600
it becomes a fraud.


00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.600
The legislative setting is very bad and studial.


00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.600
Everyone knows that they do such politics.


00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.600
Because I told you that they neither know about economics nor about diplomacy.


00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.600
If they knew about diplomacy, they would have known that this is not how diplomacy is done.


00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.600
This is like using criminals as a bargaining chip.


00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.600
Why don't they look at their own law system and economics?


00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.600
If they knew about it.


00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.220
I know that in your legal system there are many DPs


00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.120
In your legal format, Justice system


00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.120
In that, George Soros and other big capitalists


00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.400
have bought so many attorneys and judges


00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.400
Everybody knows it


00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.900
that it is not their place and they take out other people's reports


00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.820
Jay Shankar just gave a bite in a media


00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.500
He said that when we start talking, they won't like it


00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:16.500
So you also have gun shootings, you have no reason, which is a symbolism of some mental issue.


00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.500
It's a mental health issue that if there is violence for no reason,


00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:27.500
if there is violence in any part of the world, then the person who is going to do it has some logic to do it.


00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:33.500
You have no reason gun shootings, without any reason, without any logic.


00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.500
It's not terrorism that it's based on a religious doctrine.


00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.500
So this is a serious big mental issue.


00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.500
You can pick up your own syllabus and see what is being taught to your children in the West.


00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.500
There are gender related issues, transgender related stuff.


00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:59.500
Children are being deliberately instigated, impressionable minds,


00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.500
What can be your gender?


00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.500
You should find out.


00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:09.500
The entire network of the pharma industry has taken over your family in the West.


00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:15.500
You can see how the parents don't even know.


00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.500
Everything is outsourcing.


00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.500
Your kitchen is outsourcing.


00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.500
Your parenting is outsourcing.


00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500
I don't know.


00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.500
I think it's a very sick society.


00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.500
What has turned into the West.


00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.500
And I am not surprised that this is the case.


00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.500
The reason is that the addiction of fiat currency, of endless printing,


00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:43.500
who created a false narrative that the West is rich,


00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.500
we are very rich,


00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.500
they don't even know that printing machine is running here,


00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.500
it is because of this.


00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.500
Not that they are smart or they are economic wise or anything.


00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.500
So India didn't have any reserve currency.


00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:05.260
not have reserve currency when we gave 27% on an average to world GDP.


00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:11.780
For 1700 years we gave 27% to world GDP without English language and without reserve currency.


00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:15.260
What reserve currency did we have?


00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.820
So they don't know how to do economics, how to earn money.


00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:26.540
All those economists like Raghuram Rajan who follow the western template


00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:32.940
will talk about spending and consumption, stimulus, increase the liquidity supply of money


00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.660
and use such big words which people don't know about.


00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.140
They are saying to print money in the printing machine.


00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.140
That is what they are saying.


00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.620
These big economists who pretend to be economists


00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.700
have been doing this for so many years and follow the western template.


00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.140
Why? Because of the 20% reserve currency status of the euro currency and 59% of the dollar.


00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.380
So, because all the countries in the West have printing machines,


00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:07.980
all these economists have run the worldwide idea that the government should push spending and consumption by supply of money.


00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:13.020
So, the only solution to every economic problem is to increase liquidity and supply of money.


00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.380
You can see how all the families were destroyed in the West.


00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.940
You can see the result.


00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:26.980
So they have destroyed their entire society just for keeping the reserve currency status.


00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:35.420
To remain rich for free, they used the printing machine for 4-5 decades.


00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.100
And their entire society has been destroyed.


00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:44.100
which is very important which is why they don't know anything about savings.


00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.100
You will never see an economist who is talking about savings.


00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.100
Why? Because the West has printing machines.


00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.100
They will talk about GDP, they will talk about per capita income.


00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.100
What is in the formula of GDP?


00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.100
It measures the performance of a country for a year.


00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:13.100
When you are measuring a year's performance in GDP or quarter wise, you cannot take a capital amount in such a short term.


00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.100
They are keeping capital investment in the formula. Why? It's a capital item.


00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.100
If you are measuring performance for one year, why do you put a capital item?


00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.100
Because you had a printing machine.


00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:31.100
So the capitalists in your country will take 10 crores today and after a month they will take 10 crores loan again.


00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.100
Because they are getting it in less interest.


00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.100
Till now it was going on like this.


00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.100
Right.


00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:43.100
So on that GDP, they make other countries work that you are poor.


00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.100
Why are we poor when your formula is wrong for GDP.


00:21:47.100 --> 00:22:01.980
So this whole joke has become like a joke in the world because they think that history started with them and economics started with them.


00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:11.140
So this is, you know, and then you will see all the education institutes here, there are also professors of economics, you will go and tell them.


00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.660
If you ask, they will say spending and consumption.


00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.660
No one is telling about savings.


00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.100
Why is it not telling about savings?


00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.540
Because the West has a printing machine.


00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.300
Okay.


00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.500
All the population here, who admires the West,


00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.900
Western lifestyle, oh, the government gives this benefit,


00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.420
there they give Medicaid, they put it in the retirement fund,


00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.060
they give COVID checks, they give income security,


00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.020
they give food stamps, this and that.


00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:40.620
These people don't know, the rest of the countries,


00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.320
that Americans are getting all this from your pocket.


00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:49.620
So, this whole mechanism of loot,


00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.720
mechanism of making financial colony,


00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.320
and because reserve currency status went from pound to dollar,


00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.720
I had posted last year that


00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.520
independence has to be got from Britain now


00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.020
because leadership went from pound to dollar.


00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.580
So nobody, no country is independent.


00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.800
It's a financial colony.


00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.800
Federal reserve is the central bank of all the central banks of the world.


00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:24.240
So whenever a country wants to work on monetary or fiscal policy, it has to first look at the policy of the Federal Reserve.


00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.100
Why?


00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.040
Because that is what will decide the path.


00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.340
Right?


00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:36.560
So you will see that the new development that has happened, the new bank of Japan's governor has come.


00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:48.560
I think that as the crisis events unfold, Japan's relations with the United States will be very bad.


00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.560
This is what I can foresee.


00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.560
Actually, you have touched upon a lot of points.


00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.560
Number one, on American prosperity, 30% of Americans are poor.


00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:08.320
official report is 29.1% actually but around 30% we can say. 30% is poor and


00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.840
when the world's richest country is said to be like this, 30% do not have a home and


00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:20.000
can only have one meal at a time, can't eat even twice. And the second new trend


00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.320
is that everyone is selling their homes and going to apartments and hotels.


00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:30.160
I was in Maryland for the Hindu Dharma Convention, so the hotel where I was


00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:36.160
I was living in that hotel and there were people on my floor who were thrown out of the house.


00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.160
Now I am living in a hotel.


00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.160
And how I am living in a hotel is because the government is funding them.


00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.160
And the whole floor is filled with them.


00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160
I didn't feel that this is a hotel. I felt like a barrack.


00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.160
So many people on the floor of a hotel.


00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.160
So this is the actual condition and I feel very sad to see it.


00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.160
I had never seen America like this.


00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.160
And the second thing is that infrastructure is getting damaged everywhere.


00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.480
And one thing I didn't understand, it is such a big country, why there is no alternative


00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.280
for national travel by trains?


00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.840
I didn't understand this.


00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.200
You can travel only by planes.


00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.680
Means they want to control the access point and the arrival point.


00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.680
Where people go and come.


00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.040
If there are roads, it will be independent.


00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.040
There will be trains.


00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.800
While the train network is a very big network in America.


00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800
Only for the freight.


00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800
It is not for passengers.


00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.800
So this is the actual infrastructure here.


00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.800
One question is that you talked about mental disease.


00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:43.800
There is a report of McDonald's food, in that human body parts are found in the chain.


00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.800
One inspection has been done.


00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.800
Randomly.


00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.800
I think they have made everyone a cannibals.


00:25:48.800 --> 00:26:06.600
(Freinds, Bothers dont eat there ever as you may never know what is being served to you) AI is going to do jobs, it has been automated.


00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.040
So what will be the impact of AI on this existing condition?


00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:20.080
is also going on in the west. So as I told in the previous talks that whenever extreme


00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:29.760
capitalism happens, a communist solution comes in its solution. So you will see that AI is


00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:37.920
coming or then what they are telling about universal basic income, all this or the CBDC


00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.200
which is a digital dollar Fed now


00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.200
which is a payment interface


00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.200
as you can see water testing


00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.200
has already been done


00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.200
that many western parks


00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.200
have stopped accepting cash


00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.200
so this will be the


00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.200
maximum


00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.200
then they are saying


00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.200
physical currency notes is causing


00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200
climate change basically trying


00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.200
to demonize the physical


00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200
currency notes so all this


00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200
indicates that


00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.480
And this is a very normal thing that when you are bringing back manufacturing home,


00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:19.760
which you had outsourced to China, then it is a simple thing that if you want to make


00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.400
Made in USA product competitive, then those communist theories have to come, if you want


00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.920
to get labor to work with a low salary, etc.


00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:34.400
You are bringing machines, still it is a kind of a control because you have to give socialist


00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:40.240
freebies, income security, or the universal basic income.


00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:49.680
So I see that once China gets its valuations flipped in the world,


00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.960
China's currency will go up in terms of production.


00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.960
So the West will not be able to afford.


00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.720
But the Chinese population will benefit the most.


00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.540
Why?


00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:10.880
Because they will earn more money than they were earning before.


00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.440
And people will have time for leisure.


00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:20.800
So, I see that when the Chinese society will move away from the export-oriented model,


00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.960
I mean, as the exports of the West will decrease,


00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:33.440
So that society will start becoming liberal. Russia will become one of the top two richest countries in the world.


00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.440
Because as I have said, natural resources are still there.


00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.440
Accordingly, it is the highest.


00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:45.440
But despite that, the Arctic will melt. It is a huge treasure that will come out.


00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.440
And then the dominance of its army on the new sea routes, after the Arctic melts,


00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.440
it's going to become the top two richest country.


00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.840
So I see that Russia and China society will be liberalized


00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:06.720
through the decade and the American society or western societies


00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.240
are going towards communism. This is what I can foresee


00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.320
because whenever there is an economic crisis or


00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.720
you have to bring home manufacturing, there will be pollution,


00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:27.280
low-priced labor to take made in USA products to a consumable price point.


00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:33.760
And you can see that tensions have already started.


00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.280
This is not a surprise.


00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.960
I had a 1.5 hour speech in 2016


00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.200
where I predicted three things that Trump will win the election.


00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.760
I am talking about 2016.


00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:55.920
Second prediction was that the day China is ready to face unemployment, the world of fiat reserve currency will end.


00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.800
And my third prediction was gold backed digital currency.


00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.360
So I am seeing all three of them.


00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.920
Now Texas has put a notification on gold coins.


00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.440
Tennessee is also moving towards gold coins.


00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.200
And I think there is a provision in your constitution for gold coins.


00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:23.560
officially, so there is no legal question mark on any of the US states not following the track of


00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.560
what the federal government says. So, in the future, I will see that the friction between the


00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:35.960
state and the federal government is going to increase. This is what I can foresee in the West.


00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.560
And I used to say this from the beginning that due to the torture of Chinese labor,


00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:49.400
the West is looting the fun of democracy and freedom format.


00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.520
So when they come out of this torture,


00:30:54.520 --> 00:31:00.200
you will see that the Western democracies will start facing danger from within.


00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.520
So I think this is all going in the same direction.


00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:14.800
Now, suddenly the UK, I don't know whether you read it or not, I saw that anyone keeping


00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:22.520
more than 1000 pounds in cash and not transacting in the UK digital currency, then they can


00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.520
be jailed also.


00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.520
This is pure, this is pure, they have put a fiat on people.


00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.520
This is not a matter of currency.


00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:37.520
but I am saying that we have to do this in the future because the crisis is very big.


00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:44.520
You understand one thing that how these western nations have to earn money, they don't know.


00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.520
So the printing machine, the first 300 years that I say again and again,


00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:57.520
the first 300 years by looting India, Britain built US, Canada and Australia from Indian loot.


00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:09.520
and now in the last 150 years, printing machines have been printed in the format of pound and US dollar reserve currency and they think it is wealth.


00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:16.520
Now, as soon as they will go into the world of Pagged Currency, they will have to work for earning money.


00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:22.520
I don't know how they will manage, I find it very doubtful.


00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:29.520
I feel sad, as I said family institutions, because their marriages are not intact,


00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.520
that the education of children should be completed without a loan, without a debt.


00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.520
If there is no backing of the family, then how will the career be completed?


00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:43.520
Their parents change, while graduating, 2-3 times.


00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.520
I don't know how this society will be able to give productivity or output,


00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:58.560
printing machine will shut down. I am really doubtful. I don't know how much chaos will come.


00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:06.320
I have predicted riots, I know. But how severe will be the controls because


00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:13.760
for the reset, massive control will be required. The state will have to control everyone.


00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:21.120
entire access to money. Actually, they are controlling it completely because very few


00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.760
people can move. The civilized people who are mainstream Americans, they can hardly move also.


00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.160
Everyone is dependent. And a new culture has also come of two jobs, three jobs, but manufacturing


00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:39.840
is not there because they need laborers for manufacturing. And that's why they are also


00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.360
are promoting the construction because there is nobody to work in their factories.


00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.800
So, people will come in that way.


00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:51.920
But unfortunately, the people who are coming here, no labourer wants to go there.


00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.560
Everybody wants an office job in the city.


00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:59.600
As I was seeing a report, there is a local report here, construction workers have reduced


00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:04.280
by almost 50% despite the immigration being very high.


00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.280
So defies all the logic.


00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.280
How are construction workers getting less while immigration is at the top?


00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.280
This means that the people who are coming are not going to those jobs.


00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.280
They do not have the skill set to go to those jobs.


00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.280
And there are a lot of people from India as well.


00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:22.280
I saw a live video yesterday of how they are crossing from Mexico.


00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:28.280
But generally people have a belief that the government will take care of everything.


00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.280
Like they saw the past crisis, they will also take care of it.


00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.480
But Americans also have no idea about the severity.


00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:39.280
And second, due to insurance agencies, healthcare is very expensive.


00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.280
Very, very expensive.


00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:46.800
If there is a small toothache or a slight sprain in the eye, then everything is out


00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.560
of reach of common people.


00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:56.600
Now question comes in, now that if this is the condition of the insurance agencies of


00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:03.560
US or Bharat may be insurance concept will that even work?


00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:10.080
Because Bharat tradition was always right and free.


00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.320
But now we are seeing that concept is also there that you have to pay for the health


00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320
care.


00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:21.840
So, how long will this import of American idea, failed economic system, how will the


00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.840
developing countries sustain?


00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:37.840
So, developing countries, particularly the Asian and Global South nations, I feel that


00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:44.840
because, as I said, there has been a wave of decolonization, where in France and Germany,


00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:50.840
we have seen how pre-schools are in Gurukul mode, outside open air education, forest life


00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:57.840
Australia is saying that we are removing the British Monarchs from the currency.


00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.840
In Africa, they are abusing.


00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.840
In California, the African-American community has asked for reparations for colonial torture.


00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:11.840
Italy has said that they will ban the English language.


00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:18.840
So this is a wave of decolonization in which pharma will also be touched upon.


00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:27.380
upon ho ga? Iska reason ye hai kyuki bahut saari humari traditional jo methods thi medicine


00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:32.860
ki. Main bade wale operations kiya uski baat nahi kar raha jisme modern technology lagti


00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.860
hai abhi jo lagti hai. Kisi ka accident ho gaya that all. I am not talking about that.


00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:45.160
Main baat kar raha hu wo chote chote ailments ki jo jiska aade se zyada solution humari


00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.980
kitchen ki andar hota hai ayurvedic bolo ya yunani paddhati bolo ya traditional kitchen


00:36:50.980 --> 00:37:00.100
based medicines bolo. To ye iska bhi ek generic medicine ye saare iske iske pure bahut bade


00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:06.700
scope badenge physiotherapy and all this. To ye saare alternate medicine jo treatments


00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:13.220
hai. Mujhe lagta hai usme bahut zyada homeopathy ho gaya. Usme bahut zyada scope hai jo Bharat


00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:26.220
India can provide the whole world with training, supplies, and knowledge system transfer which is beneficial for everyone.


00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:34.220
This does not harm your body or your health because all these are natural treatments.


00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.420
So there are no side effects in this.


00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:40.420
So I think that the whole wave of decolonization will start.


00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:49.260
So there will be recognition that allopathy is not probably that advisable for this small


00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.900
kind of ailments, which we can treat ourselves at home.


00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.220
So this awakening awareness will come automatically.


00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.220
You mentioned the cost of pharma.


00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.220
This is not a surprise, Aditya ji.


00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:07.220
Wherever freebies are distributed,


00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.220
in any country,


00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.220
wherever you talk about socialism,


00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.220
the products that are connected to it


00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:19.220
are sold at a very high price to the general public.


00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.220
For example, you have a Medicaid facility there.


00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.220
Now, how effective is that Medicaid coverage?


00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:27.500
That is a side note.


00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:32.700
But because of that, the impact of private sector pharma


00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.660
because of this Medicaid benefit,


00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:42.620
the impact is that all the costs related to medicine or treatment


00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.380
that will go skyrocket.


00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:46.620
And this is not a surprise.


00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.340
Suppose I give an example,


00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:51.380
if Arvind Kejriwal is saying that free electricity,


00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.780
then it is a simple thing that whoever is going to be charged for electricity,


00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:02.780
The one who is not getting it for free, will be the one who will be paying for it.


00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:13.780
So, the general public, the freebies they get, the prices of all the related products go up suddenly.


00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:22.780
So, I am not surprised that the insurance and medicine treatment related costs are more expensive in the West.


00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.780
It is very obvious.


00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:31.780
When you talk about India, our Prime Minister has brought a lot of schemes.


00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:39.780
Suppose a poor person has to cover 5 lakhs in operations by getting a card made.


00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.780
These are all schemes.


00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:48.780
But this is a filter only for the poor people.


00:39:48.780 --> 00:40:08.780
There are economic criteria and the other is that these operations or benefits are only to ensure that poor families are not in debt trouble just because of one disease.


00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:15.780
So to secure that, now you cannot compare this with any western economy.


00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.780
This is not happening in western economy.


00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.780
The problem of western economy is different.


00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:25.780
Your problem is that you have given Medicaid to a vast majority of population


00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.780
who probably did not even need that Medicaid.


00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.780
Right, they did not even need that benefit.


00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:42.780
But because you have given it, the private sector, pharma and medicine costs have skyrocketed.


00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.780
They have become the outcome of it.


00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:50.780
Because you have given the benefit of Medicaid to those who did not deserve it.


00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.780
So, because of that, after so many decades, the trickle-down impact has come that


00:40:55.780 --> 00:41:01.780
which could have been done 30 years ago without Medicaid.


00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:09.780
Now, it cannot afford without Medicaid and the taxes and cuts imposed by Medicaid


00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.780
have become expensive and the private sector has become completely mischievous.


00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.780
Whatever they want to charge.


00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.780
So, these are the negative impacts of socialism.


00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.780
So, communism and capitalism at extreme ends


00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:28.780
complement each other.


00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.780
It works like this.


00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.780
One has to exploit, only then the communist comes in solution.


00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.780
And then the communist becomes an excuse for the private sector


00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:44.780
that now we have to charge otherwise how will we run the business.


00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:50.780
So, by complimenting like this, they exploit the masses.


00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:59.220
Actually, you have explained it in great detail because this is exactly what is happening.


00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:05.540
And the American scholarly pride, scholarly consensus pride.


00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.540
One last question.


00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:14.220
The academic system has scholarly consensus where only the European thought process is


00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.500
promoted.


00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.780
No non-European thought process is promoted.


00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:23.460
And because of that, people like me and others who have an alternative version of American


00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.260
history get sidelined.


00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:30.340
And we don't have a problem, we sell more because of that.


00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.020
So we want them to continue what they are doing.


00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:40.020
for the State Department of USA to talk with any other country, it's a big problem for the other country, not for the State Department.


00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:50.020
So, now the African Union has also started abusing. So, what is the future of this scholarly consensus or rather unholy, unscholarly consensus?


00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:55.420
We have to see the backward linkage of this, Mr. Aditya.


00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.620
As soon as the pegged currency goes into the world,


00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.120
no matter how many excuses it gives, whether it is AI or climate change,


00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:08.820
whatever the currency reset is, whatever name it gives,


00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:14.620
the immediate action that will come after this,


00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:19.720
we will see that many academic colleges will be locked.


00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:31.720
Because if colleges are not able to guarantee jobs even after 15-20 years of investment,


00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.720
then that education system automatically collapses.


00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:45.720
So, this whole nexus that you are talking about, where a twisted history is deliberately taught,


00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:55.220
because there are some vested interests which are given psychological impact by young impressionable minds


00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:01.720
and because we need masses like that who are blank, who don't know history,


00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.720
or who know wrong history or twisted history.


00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.720
A lot of vested interest is needed for this to happen.


00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:21.720
So I think when the economy of jobs collapses, the whole setup of automatic academics that was supporting vested interest will also come into question.


00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.720
and then it will be completely unraveled.


00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.720
Now the question is here and I am not, frankly speaking, I am, to be very honest,


00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:40.720
I don't think that the nations of the West have that much wisdom and why should we expect that wisdom


00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:46.720
because they were born 300-400 years ago, 500 years ago, so they were born just now,


00:44:46.720 --> 00:45:00.720
How can you expect them to have the wisdom to run their lives, what should be the economics, what is a family institution, what is a relationship, what is religion, what is the role of religion in economics?


00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:05.720
I don't think we should expect this wisdom from the West.


00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.720
Because when they came here, they came to destroy everything.


00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.720
They didn't come here to adopt anything.


00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:24.720
So I think this is our responsibility as Indians to dig out and show the guiding path to the world.


00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.720
And I see how France is doing and you will see Greece will also come.


00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:35.720
One by one, the EU nations will have their first awakening because there is a crisis there.


00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.720
You have to come late for your crisis.


00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:53.720
So, EU nations, I think India can contribute a lot in European societies and can help solve their problems with our ancient India wisdom.


00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.720
But they have to learn, like Macron himself has come.


00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:04.720
So, such leaders have to come and say that we are clueless, now help us.


00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.720
So when this...


00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.720
Because one time will come when...


00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.720
Because I tell you that this is our century.


00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.720
So one time will come when India will have to say,


00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.720
"You all sit quietly, you have to do what we are telling you."


00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:23.720
So India will have to take this role ahead aggressively.


00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.720
Which some of the tricks of which Jai Shankar Ji shows sometimes.


00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.720
He gives some trailers, some...


00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.720
When he gives bites.


00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:38.720
But it has to be more aggressive and that is for the benefit of humanity.


00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.720
All the embassies of India will have to build a temple.


00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.720
Then we will have to say that you guys build a temple of Lord Hanuman and we will talk about it.


00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.720
Some counter condition has to be there.


00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:51.720
Maybe there is so much of stubbornness in our politicians.


00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.720
We will be expecting that.


00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.000
will be expecting that.


00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.640
they can be conter questioned


00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:10.360
and asked straight away to stop cow slaughter in whole America and Asia and establish Temples altogather..


00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.360
The question mark of Indian economics is still a little bit ahead.


00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.360
I am talking about wide acceptability.


00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:19.360
Even the masses should understand that all this was wrong.


00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.360
So when that acknowledgement will come


00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:27.360
and they will see that Indian economics has been going on for 1700 years,


00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:32.360
is still going on, is still in autopilot mode and is moving forward.


00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:38.360
So because the mindset of the West is such that they weigh everything in money.


00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:48.360
So, till the time you don't show economic prosperity to India, India will not get that role to guide us.


00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.360
So, a big boom will take a decade.


00:47:52.360 --> 00:48:00.360
And then you will see that the Sanatan economics model that I am talking about,


00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.680
If they ask from the front, they will say that this is right, because this is what is preserving


00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.480
the life cycle, then it must be correct.


00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.480
Right.


00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:17.680
